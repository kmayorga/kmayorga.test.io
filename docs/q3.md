## Auditing Time Entry

Before the close of the year, we need to confirm that all time entry in ELT, T2ST and T1ST has been backlogged and is up to date. We don’t want an ACM to graduate with a week’s left of T2ST not backlogged. PMs should work with their teams to confirm the following:

- All time entry has been completed and is happening in real time as of May
- Time entry errors are being corrected; Any records shown on the Data validation page shown below may need correcting.

## Indictor Areas

### Adding Indicator Areas

Indicator areas are used by HQ to identify focus list students. Students that do not have an indicator area assigned to them, will not be counted in any end of the year reports created by HQ. It is vital that students get assigned indicator areas for this reason, else senior leaders will see inaccurate data for our site. Follow the step-by-step guide below to add indicator areas:

- Open [CYSH](https://cityyear.okta.com/home/salesforce/0oa1itg0i12uHbL4V0h8/46?fromHome=true) in your browser
- Go to the 'Sections' tab in the blue ribbon
- Open a section in ELA, Math or SEL (*Note: indicator areas are only assigned in these sections not in ELT)
- Select all students by clicking on the box at the top-left corner

### Removing Indicator Areas

## EOY Partner Survey

## Destroying Student Data

Per the districts requirements we are not allowed to possess data as individuals when we no longer work for the district. This means that ACMs will need to complete the following tasks:

> 1. Delete all digital documents with student names AND Performance/demographic data
> 2. Destroy any physical documents with student names AND Performance/demographic data
> 3. Work with your PM to secure any student records on City Year platforms so that they are not accessible to anyone other than future teams from your school
> 4. Ensure that your focus list records are accurate in CYSchoolhouse before graduation
> 5. PMs should confirm that the Middle of year tasks are completed as well
