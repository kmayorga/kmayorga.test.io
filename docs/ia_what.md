# What is Impact Analytics
*The mission* of the impact analytics team is to foster data informed decision making that supports corps and staff in executing towards organizational excellence and student outcomes.
  
We hope to support the site in **learning fast and deciding with clarity**. We work to ensure that the organization has the technical systems to reflect on their work and set goals accordingly. We call this process of regularly checking in on the data “Progress monitoring”.

The Analytics team manages some key processes and timelines relating to physical service. This includes:
- The technical process of placing corps members into schools and classes
- The technical process and tools for after school data collection
- The technical process of selecting focus list students
- Overall data management and data visualization at the site
