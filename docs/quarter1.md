# Getting Teacher & Student Data

### Data Access (Teacher schedules for In Class Deployment)

Data is key to much of what the Analytics team does each year but as a contractor for the district we can only get a limited scope of data and it must be stored securely. For both of our school districts the process of getting student data is different. See your school district below for more specifics on how to get school specific data for ACM deployment, focus lists and ELT.


Los Angeles Unified School District

In June CYLA should communicate to LAUSD Office of Data and Accountability about re-establishing a data use contract for the coming school year. This process has been historically slow and should be started as soon as possible. 

To assist in this process, we need directors and managers to provide the Analytics team with a list of the intended teacher classes that ACMs will be providing services. This should be done via the draft deployment tool discussed below. Analytics may also need school partners to run teacher schedule reports for LA Unified schools so that we get the teacher names and course names to officially send to LAUSD data team so that we can request student records. More details will be provided below if that’s the case.


Inglewood Unified School District


Inglewood uses a data platform called Schoolzilla to manage their data. City Year uses Schoolzilla to access student performance data for your schools. Sometime in the first quarter the Analytics team will provide a training specifically for IUSD schools on how to access Schoolzilla for viewing student performance data.

 # Draft ACM Class Deployment
 In the summer as you plan with partners where ACMs will be placed into class lines with teachers, please fill out a copy of this draft deployment workbook. This workbook will help you build ACM schedules but also eventually become a key part of our Data model allowing ACMs to see students’ data from their classes and manage their focus lists. Without a draft deployment, our team will not be able to access data for students in ACM classes, please complete by: (XX/XX/XXXX).

 Sometime in September when the Analytics team gets access to student enrollment, we will send a final deployment workbook for PMs to copy data over into. This final workbook will be the one used to build out our data models for Power BI reports which is critical for functional and FERPA compliant student progress monitoring.

 ***Our current estimates for the rollout of all class deployment items is listed above and subject to change.***


# Supporting ACMS Through the Focus List Process
### The Focus List Process FY22
In FY22 the focus list process is being simplified to have less steps and allow for greater flexibility in selecting students. Rather than starting with an initial caseload of students and then narrowing it down to a final focus list Corps members will just pick a caseload of 11 students when they feel like they have identified the correct students to receive services. The timeline for this process is listed below

The Initial Focus List process begins with completing your school’s draft Deployment Workbook Template. Completion of the draft Deployment Workbook signifies that your team has been deployed into stable class lines and are ready to take steps towards building their initial focus list. Prior to making selections, ACMs will begin their student observation window (1-2 weeks). During this time, ACMs will begin to identify potential students, have initial ***conversations with their partner teachers, and explore the Student Portrait dashboard.***

- ACMs will observe students in their classes
- ACMS will have initial conversations with partner teachers and consider their recommendations
- ACMs will explore the Student Portrait Dashboard on Power BI
    - Prior year attendance & grades

During this period, the IA team will give PMs and ACMs access to their school’s Focus List Workbooks. Once ACMs have solidified their initial list of 11 students, they may input their information into the focus list workbook.

- Select 11 students who may be ideal for a focus list
- Input student information into Focus List Workbook
        - Student ID (included in the Student Portrait Dashboard), subject, SED indicator

The general timelines for the focus list process are below and are subject to change. Keep in mind these are recommended windows in which things should progress and your school may be different.

### What to Look for in a Focus List and Early Warning Indicators (EWI)
When selecting a focus list student, it is important to consider the following:

- [ ] In the past year, was this student on track or off track?
      - 96% or higher attendance
      - Passing ELA and Math classes
      - No more than 1 behavior mark the prior year
- [ ] Does the student have low attendance last year or within the first ten weeks of this year?
        - Missing more than two days of the first month of school
- [ ] Is the student missing assignments or scoring low on in class content in the first month?
